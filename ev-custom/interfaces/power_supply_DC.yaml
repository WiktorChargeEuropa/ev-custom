  setImportVoltageCurrent:
    description: >-
      Set minimal import voltage and current limit.  Must be within reported
      limits.
    arguments:
      voltage:
        description: Current will be drawn if input is above this voltage (in Volt)

      phase:
        description: >-
          Charging phase for this mode change. This information should normally not be needed by the power supply,
          as it should always just operate in CCCV mode. Some special setups however are handling CableCheck/PreCharge/Charge
          a little bit different internally.
